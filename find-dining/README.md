# Find Dining

Find Dining was created to help indecisive friends solve the age old question, 'where should we eat?'. With this app, friends can swipe through a selection of restaurants based on the city and radius of their choosing and then get 'matched' on a random restaurant from a list of common selections.
Here is a link to our [app](https://find-dining.netlify.app/)
